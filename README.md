# C-MS-PAINT-project
This project is a feature-rich MS Paint application built in C, offering a wide range of creative tools and functionalities. Users can create, edit, save and manipulate various shapes, including geometrical shapes, alphabets, and numbers. The application also supports freehand drawing, allowing users to unleash their creativity.
In this project I used MVC method (monitor(data),view(brain) and control(interface))
In data folder, we have many files. In .c files, we have logic of all respective shapes and in .h we have definition and in data_header.h we have master header file.
In brain folder, we have 3 files. In brain.c we decided which shape should be call from data.c and in brain.h we have definitions and brain_header.h we have all header files
In interface folder, we have 3 files. In interface.c we take input from users about color,size,position and symbol etc and in interface_header.h we have all header files.
